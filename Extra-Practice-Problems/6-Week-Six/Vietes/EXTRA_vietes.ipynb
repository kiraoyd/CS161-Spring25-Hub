    "Viete's formula to approximate the value of Pi looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Viete's formula for Pi](../../../images/Vietes.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The pattern begins with the square root of 2, divided by 2. Each iteration that is multiplied to get the final product changes in a predictable way. The more iterations that get multiplied, the better the approximation of Pi that results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Notice that the final product must be divided by 2 in order to isolate the value of Pi.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your Task\n",
    "Write a function that calculates Viete's Pi for you. Call it `viete`, and have it take **one argument**: a value for **n** representing the number of factors in Viete's Pi your function will calculate up to. The number of factors in the picture above is 3. The function should **return** the final approximated value for Pi.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to use a **while-loop**. Don't get too hung up on the math, and instead focus on finding the pattern in the way each factor changes. You probably won't need more than 15 lines of code...\n",
    "\n",
    "Allow the person using the program to give as input the number of factors your program will calculate.  Gather the value for **n** as input in `main()`. Call the fibonacci function from `main()`, catch and output the returning value for the approximate value of Pi  from `main()`.\n",
