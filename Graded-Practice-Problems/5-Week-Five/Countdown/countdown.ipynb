    "### 1) Write the **function definition header**\n",
    "\n",
    "Name your function: `countdown`.\n",

    "The **function body** code should use the value passed into the **parameter** to perform the job of the function. \n",
    "\n",
    "This function should **output** every integer value in the sequence from **n** to 1. After each number is displayed, the program should pause for exactly one second.\n",
