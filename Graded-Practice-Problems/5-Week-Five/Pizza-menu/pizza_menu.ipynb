    "# Pair Programming: Updating the Pizza Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Work with a partner using the practice of **Pair Programming** to build upon the solution code for the Pizza Comparison Program (provided in the Code Cell below).\n",
    "\n",
    "Develop the provided code to add the following feature:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Add a simple **main program menu** to your `main()` calling routine. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**IF you use the provided code....before you begin writing ANY code, read and trace through the provided code together and make sure you both understand how the computer moves through the program.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) In `main()`, show the menu options\n",
    "\n",
    "Display an output message to the person using the program, that explains their two choices as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Type 1 to calculate and compare the value of two pizzas, type 0 to quit.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) Get the persons menu choice as input\n",
    "\n",
    "Store their menu choice as an integer value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) Evaluate their choice\n",
    "\n",
    "If the person types a 0, they have chosen to quit and the program ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the person types a 1, they have chosen to run the program. Run the Pizza Program as previously written.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the person types in any other **integer** besides a 0 or a 1, this is an **invalid choice**. In this case, output a message that says: \"Sorry, that is not a valid menu choice.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**No matter what happens, the program should always end with the message: \"Goodbye!\"**\n",

    "## **Challenge: Practice Code Abstraction**\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify your **main program menu**, can you abstract the entirety of the Pizza Calculator Program into it's own user-defined function? \n",
    "\n",
    "By doing this, for the condition where the person types a '1' into the main program menu as their choice, the only code needed inside that condition is a single call to this new function.\n",
