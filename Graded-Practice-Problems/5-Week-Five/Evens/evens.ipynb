This function must use a **while-loop** to get the job done, and a **conditional statement** within the while-loops code body.\n",

    "### 1) Write the **function definition header**\n",
    "\n",
    "Name your function: `show_evens`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) Write the **function body code**\n",
    "The **function body** code should use value passed into the **parameter** to perform the job of the function. \n",
    "\n",
    "This function does **NOT** need to **return** any value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) Use the function in main()\n",
    "\n",
    "Define a `main()` function. \n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt and gather the value for **n** as **input**, and store this information in a **variable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Call the `show_evens` function you wrote, from `main()`, passing it the input value you just stored. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 4) Output any results in main()\n",
    "\n",
    "The `show_evens` function will not return any values. So there is no need to do anything in `main()` after the function is called, except display a message that says: \"Goodbye!\".\n",
