    "## Main Program Menu\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple **Main Program Menu** allows the person using the program to choose to either run it, or quit. \n",
    "\n",
    "Write a main calling routine that offers these two choices to the person using the program. Handle a situation where the person enters an invalid choice.\n",

    "# Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) Define a `main()` function. \n",
    "\n",
    "Don't forget to call `main()` below the definition!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) Show the menu options\n",
    "\n",
    "Display an output message to the person using the program, that explains their two choices as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Type 1 to run the program, type 0 to quit.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"background-color: #F8F8F8; border: 4px solid #A76BCF; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;\">\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Bonus: Can you write this output statement as it's own user-defined function called `show_menu_options`?\n",
    "\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",

    "### 3) Get the persons choice as input\n",

    "\n",

    "### 4) Evaluate their choice\n",
    "\n",
    "If the person types a 0, they have chosen to quit and the program ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the person types a 1, they have chosen to run the program. Output a message that says \"Running the program...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "If the person types in any other **integer** besides a 0 or a 1, this is an **invalid choice**. In this case, output a message that says: \"Sorry, that is not a valid menu choice.\"\n",

    "**No matter what happens, the program should always end with the message: \"Goodbye!\"**\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "As of now this main menu has two options: run the program, or quit.\n",
    "\n",
    "But you have the power to add another option, or many more options! \n",
    "\n",
    "1) Try adding a third option: \"Type 2 to hear a joke.\"\n",
    "2) Now come up with a fourth and fifth option of your own, and add them to the menu.\n",

    "And remember: if you add a new option to the menu code, you'll want to update the output message that presents these options to the person using your program.\n",
