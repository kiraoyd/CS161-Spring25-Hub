    "Write a game where the player tries to guess a number between 1 and 10. The hidden number is generated as a random integer between 1 and 10 in your program. \n",

    "### 1) Define `main()`.\n",

    "### 3) Welcome the player, and let the player take their first guess.\n",
    "\n",
    "Get their input value and convert it to an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4) Write a while-loop that breaks if the person guesses correctly or if the person runs out of guesses (they have 3 total guesses).\n",
    "\n",
    "Within this loop the work that needs to be done is:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1) Evaluate the guess against the hidden number, does it match?\n",
    "  2) If it matches, ensure something changes so the loop condition becomes False and breaks.\n",
    "  3) If it doesn't match, display a message telling them why: was the guess too high, or too low?  The person should get to guess again as long as they still haven't exhausted their 3 total guesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5) Add a Main Program Menu\n",
    "\n",
    "Now write a Main Program Menu in `main()` that runs on a loop. Give the person three options:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) See the game Instructions \n",
    "2) Play the game\n",
    "0) Quit\n",
    "\n",
    "Based off a value entered as input, one of these three options should be selected. Once an option is selected and runs, the main menu should be re-offered to the person using the program. The only time the main menu should NOT be re-offered, is if the person chooses option 0: to quit the program.\n",
    "\n",
