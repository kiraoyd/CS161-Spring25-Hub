    "# Average of User Data in a List\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have data in a List, we can **traverse / iterate** over that List to examine each piece of data one by one. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to write a program that creates a list of user-input data (as integers), then iterates over that List to calculate the average of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry about abstracting this program into functions just yet. Write everything in main().\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) Write a `main()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't forget to call main()!\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) In `main()`, create a List and fill it with user-input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a new, empty List.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use an input-driven loop to let the person using the program enter one non-negative integer at a time as data. Every integer they enter gets appended to the List.\n",
    "\n",
    "To break the loop and discontinue entering data, the person using your program needs to enter the **terminating value** of -1. **Do not count the terminating value as data, and make sure it is not appended to the List.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) Process the Data: in `main()`, iterate over the List of Data and calculate the Average of all data\n",
    "\n",
    "Determine the length /size of the List using `len()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the length to determine the value of the `last_index` in the List. This will always be one less than the length of the List.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a while-loop that iterates over the List, starting at index 0 and working up to the last_index.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each index, access the value stored at that location in the List and use it to calculate the average of all data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4) Handle for no data entered\n",
    "\n",
    "What if the user enters NO data? Write a conditional check that checks for this **before** any data processing happens. If the List is empty, output a message explaining that there is no data to process. Only process the data and calculate the average in the event the List is not empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "## For Reference: Code for Calculating Average of Data entered in an input loop\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def calculate_average():\n",
    "    average = 0\n",
    "    my_sum = 0\n",
    "    count = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "    number = int(input(\"Enter data one at a time, enter a -1 to stop: \"))\n",
    "    while number != -1:\n",
    "        my_sum = my_sum + number #add the new data to the total\n",
    "        count = count + 1 #tally up the data\n",
    "\n",
    "        #get a new piece of data, it might be the terminating value of -1\n",
    "        number = int(input(\"Enter data one at a time, enter a -1 to stop: \"))\n",
    "\n",
    "    #After the loop breaks, we have all the info we need to calculate the average\n",
    "    #but only if we got data entered, if there was no data entered\n",
    "    if my_sum != 0 and count != 0:\n",
    "        average = my_sum / count\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        average = -1 #error flag, no data entered\n",
    "\n",
    "    return average\n",
    "        \n",
    "                \n",
