    "![rated R](../../../images/rollercoaster.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Most amusement parks don't like getting sued, so they post safety restrictions on their roller-coasters to ensure humans small enough to fall out of the harnesses don't end up on the ride. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lets pretend there's a roller-coaster out there that also assumes anyone over 15 can decide for themselves if they think they'll be safe on the ride. This roller-coaster just requires you to *either* be **taller than 52 inches** or **older than 15 years** to be able to ride.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to write a program that decides, based on some age value entered in and some height value entered in weather or not a person will be allowed on this roller-coaster.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Instructions\n",
    "Write a function called `can_ride` that takes two arguments, and returns one value. This functions job is to determine if someone is old enough (**older than 15 years**) or tall enough (**taller than 52 inches**) to be permitted to ride the roller-coaster.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) Write the **function definition header**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def can_ride(some_age, some_height):\n",
    "  #write the function body code (the code that does the work), here\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) Write the **function body code**\n",
    "The **function body** code should evaluate the value passed into the parameter called `age` and evaluate the value passed into the parameter called `height`. There are multiple possible situations where the person should be allowed to ride this roller-coaster:\n",
    "- The person is both old enough and tall enough.\n",
    "- The person is old enough, but not tall enough.\n",
    "- The person is tall enough, but not old enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "In any of these cases, the function should **return the boolean value `True`.**\n",
    "\n",
    "There is only one situation where the person cannot ride this roller-coaster:\n",
    "- The person is neither old enough, nor tall enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the function should **return the boolean value `False`.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The boolean value for True in python syntax is `True`. Example: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "result = True\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The boolean value for false in python syntax is `False`. Example: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "result = False\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) Use the function in main()\n",
    "\n",
    "Define a **main() function**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt and gather the age (in whole years) of the person in question, as input, and store this information in a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt and gather the height (in inches) of the person in question, as input, and store this information in a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Call your `can_ride()` function from `main()`, passing it the value for age and the value for height as arguments. Catch the result in some other variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 4) Output the Results in main()\n",
    "\n",
    "In `main()`, depending on the value that is caught returning from the call to `can_ride()`, output a different final message:\n",
    "\n",
    " - If `can_ride()` returns `True`, output: `You can ride the roller-coaster!.`.\n",
    " - If `can_ride()` returns `False`, output: `Sorry, you can't ride the roller-coaster`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " # Challenge: Customize the final output messages\n",
    "\n",
    " Since there's more than one reason a person might meet the safety criteria for the roller-coaster it might be nice to know WHY you were allowed to ride.\n",
    "\n",
    " Change the function body code and the code in main() so that the person using the program gets a customized final output message, depending on the situation:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1) \"You might be real young, but since you're so tall I guess you can ride the roller-coaster.\"\n",
    " 2) \"You're pretty short, but seeing as you're older than 15 I suppose we'll have to trust your judgment. Just hold on tight\"\n",
    " 3) \"You're old enough, and tall enough! Enjoy the ride!\"\n",
    " 4) \"Sorry, you can't ride the roller-coaster.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** returning a Boolean type (`True` or `False`) from the `can_ride()` function won't be enough anymore. What single value type could you return instead that might be able to carry different information depending on the situation?\n"
