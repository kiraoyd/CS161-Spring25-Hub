    "# Guess the Number Program\n",

    "Let's write a little guessing game. In this game, the computer will generate a random integer between 1 and 10. The person playing the game will take a guess by entering a number as input. If the two numbers match, the person wins! If not, they lose.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Instructions\n",
    "Write a function called `take_a_guess()` that takes one argument, and returns one value. This functions job is to generate a random integer between 1 and 10, and check to see if some number passed in as an argument matches it. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) Write the **function definition header**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def take_a_guess(guess):\n",
    "  #write the function body code (the code that does the work), here\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) Write the **function body code**\n",
    "The **function body** code should generate a random number between 1 and 10 and store that value in a variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then it should evaluate the value passed into the parameter called `guess`. There are two possible outcomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the `guess` value is equivalent to the randomly generated number value, the function returns the boolean value `True`.\n",
    "- Otherwise, if the two values do NOT match, the function returns the boolean value `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The boolean value for True in python syntax is `True`. Example: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "result = True\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The boolean value for false in python syntax is `False`. Example: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "result = False\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Which value, `True` or `False`, the function returns once it's job is done, depends entirely on what value for `guess` is received as an argument and how that value is evaluated by the function body code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) Use the function in main()\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a **main() function** that prompts for and gathers the number guess of the person in question, as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Call your `take_a_guess()` function from main(), passing it that input value. Catch the result in some variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 4) Output the Results in main()\n",
    "\n",
    "In main(), depending on the value that is caught returning from the call to `take_a_guess()`, output a different final message:\n",
    "\n",
    " - If `take_a_guess()` returns `True`, output: `That's my number! You win!`.\n",
    " - If `take_a_guess()` returns `False`, output: `Sorry, that's not my number. You lose.`.\n",
