    "In the original Pokemon Red and Pokemon Blue games, you got to choose up front which of three adorable pocket monsters you were going to start out with. This was a gut wrenching and paralyzing decision for those of us who hate options.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to write a program to help. This program will randomly choose one out of the three pokemon, and insist you to pick that one. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Instructions\n",
    "Write a function called `roll_die()` that takes no arguments, and returns one value. This functions job is to simulate randomly rolling a **6-sided die**. It returns a random integer. Hmm...where have we seen something like this before....\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a second function called `choose_pokemon()`, that takes a single argument and returns no values. This functions job is to take whatever integer is passed to is as an argument, and output a different message.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) Write the **function definition headers**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def roll_die():\n",
    "  #write the function body code (the code that does the work), here\n",
    "\n",
    "def choose_pokemon(number):\n",
    "  #write the function body code (the code that does the work), here  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) Write the **function body code**\n",
    "The **function body** code for `roll_die()` should randomly generate an integer between 1 and 6 inclusive, and return that value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **function body** code for `choose_pokemon()` should, depending on the value that is caught returning from the call to `roll_die()`, output a different final message:\n",
    "\n",
    " - If `choose_pokemon()` is passed the number `1`, output: `I choose you, Squirtle!`.\n",
    " - If `choose_pokemon()` is passed the number `2`, output: `I choose you Charmander!`.\n",
    "  - If `choose_pokemon()` is passed the number `3`, output: `I choose you Bulbasaur!`.\n",
    "  - If `choose_pokemon()` is passed a number larger than 3, but smaller than 5, output: `Oh no, you can't decide!`\n",
    "  - If `choose_pokemon()` is passed a number larger than 5 output: `Secret Starter Pokemon Glitch Unlocked! I choose all three!`\n",
    "\n",
    "**BE CAREFUL! You only want __one single__ output statement per run of the program.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) Use **both** functions in main() \n",
    "\n",
    "Define a **main() function**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome the person to the program and explain what the program does.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt the user to hit the `enter` key to have the program choose their pokemon.  You can use the `input()` function as a stand-alone prompt to do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "input(\"Hit enter to choose your pokemon >>>\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Call your `roll_die()` function and catch the result in a variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Call your `choose_pokemon()` function and pass it the value `roll_die()` returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " # Challenge: Handle for errors\n",
    "\n",
    "What if your `choose_pokemon()` function accidentally gets passed a number that is **negative**? Update this function so that outputs some kind of error message in that case. Do it only with conditional statements, do not use any `try/except` blocks here.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Extra Challenge: Add a feature to `choose_pokemon()`\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe you want the computer to remember the name of the chosen pokemon, for the rest of the program.  Update the `choose_pokemon()` function so that not only does it output a different message depedning on the number passed in as an argument, but it also sets a variable called `pokemon_name` to the name of the chosen pokemon. Return the variable holding the chosen pokemons name, catch and save that string value back in `main()`. In the super secret glitch case, the name returned can simply be \"everyone\".\n",
