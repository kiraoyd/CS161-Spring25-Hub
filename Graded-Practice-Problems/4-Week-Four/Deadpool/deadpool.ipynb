    "If you're under 17 and heading off to see Deadpool in theaters alone, you better hope you have a convincing fake ID or you're not going to be able to buy a ticket.\n",

    "We are going to write a program that decides, based on some age value entered in, weather or not that person can watch Deadpool (legally).\n",

    "# Instructions\n",
    "Write a function called `rated_r_approved` that takes one argument, and returns one value. This functions job is to determine if someone is old enough to watch an R-rated movie or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) Write the **function definition header**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def rated_r_approved(age):\n",
    "  #write the function body code (the code that does the work), here\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) Write the **function body code**\n",
    "The **function body** code should evaluate the value passed into the parameter called `age`. There are a few possible outcomes:\n",
    "- If the `age` value is greater than or equal to 17, the person is old enough and the function returns the boolean value `True`.\n",
    "- Otherwise, if the `age` value is less than 17, the person is NOT old enough, and the function returns the boolean value `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The boolean value for True in python syntax is `True`. Example: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "result = True\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The boolean value for false in python syntax is `False`. Example: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "result = False\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Which value, `True` or `False`, the function returns once it's job is done, depends entirely on what value for `age` is received as an argument and how that value is evaluated by the function body code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) Use the function in main()\n",
    "\n",
    "Define a **main() function**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt and gather the age of the person in question, as input, and store this information in a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Call your `rated_r_apporved()` function from main(), passing it the input value you just stored. Catch the result in some other variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 4) Output the Results in main()\n",
    "\n",
    "In main(), depending on the value that is caught returning from the call to `rated_r_approved`, output a different final message:\n",
    "\n",
    " - If `rated_r_approved()` returns `True`, output: `You're old enough! Enjoy the movie.`.\n",
    " - If `rated_r_approved()` returns `False`, output: `Sorry, you're too young to watch this kind of film.`.\n",
