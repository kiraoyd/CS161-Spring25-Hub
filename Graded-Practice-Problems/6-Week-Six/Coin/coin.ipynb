    "# Coin Flip - Monte Carlo Probability\n",

    "This program will calculate the chances of landing on heads when flipping a coin, by way of Monte Carlo Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "## YOUR TASK\n",
    "Your Program should to the following\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a success counter\n",
    "2. Randomly Generate 0 or 1 (0 will represent the face side of a coin and 1 will represent the tail side of a coin)\n",
    "3. If the coin lands on heads, increase the success counter by 1\n",
    "4. Repeat step 2 and step 3, 100,000 times (each time counts as a trial)\n",
    "5. Output the probability results of the simulation, which should be right around `50%`.\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "## Hints\n",
    "* The probability result of a Monte Carlo simulation is calculated by dividing the total number of successes by the total number of trials and multiplying the result by 100\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "probability = (success/trials) * 100\n",
    "```\n",
    "## Note\n",
    "* Due of the random nature of this program, the result will not always be exactly 50%, but should come in close to it.\n",
