    "### 1) Write the **function definition header**\n",
    "\n",
    "Name your function: `fizz_buzz()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) Write the **function body code**\n",
    "The **function body** code should use the value passed into the **parameter** to perform the job of the function. \n",
    "\n",
    "This function should iterate over every number from 0 to *n*, inclusive using the rules defined above. \n",
    "\n",
    "This function should **NOT** return anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) Use the function in main()\n",
    "\n",
    "Define a `main()` function. \n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt the user for some positive, integer-valued number. Store the user's **input** in some **variable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Call the `fizz_buzz()` function you wrote, from `main()`, passing it the input value you just stored. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 4) Terminating message in main()\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the program terminates, display a message that says: \"Goodbye!\".\n"
