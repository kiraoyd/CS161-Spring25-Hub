    "# Snake Eyes\n",
    "\n",
    "![two die both rolling a 1](../../../images/snake_eyes.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this program, we will be calculating the chances of getting *snake eyes*--rolling a pair of dice and obtaining two 1's. We will calculate our probabilities using a while-loop to create a **Monte Carlo Simulation**. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) Write the **function definition header**\n",
    "\n",
    "Name your function: `snake_eyes()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) Write the **function body code**\n",
    "The **function body** code should accept one value passed into the **parameter**, called `n`. The value of `n` will indicate the number of trials our program should run. \n",
    "\n",
    "For each trial, randomly generate a pair of dice values (1-6) using random.randint(). If both dice have the value 1, it's snake eyes, count it! Repeat `n` number of times. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Return** the calculated probability which should be around `2.77%`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hints\n",
    "The probability result of a Monte Carlo simulation is calculated by dividing the total number of successes by the total number of trials and multiplying the result by 100. That is,\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "probability = (success/trials) * 100\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note\n",
    "* Due to the random nature of this program, the result will not always be ~2.77%\n",
    "* As a result, you may have to run the program several times\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) Use the function in main()\n",
    "\n",
    "Define a `main()` function. \n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt the user for some positive, integer-valued number. Store the user's **input** in some **variable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Call the `snake_eyes()` function you wrote, from `main()`. Pass it the input value (you will want to input a value of at least 10000 to get good probability). Let `snake_eyes()` do its work, then catch and store the returning probability value in `main().`\n",
    "\n",
    "Output a message displaying the probability results of the simulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 4) Terminating message in main()\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the program terminates, display a message that says: \"Goodbye!\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Output\n",
    "```txt\n",
    "Enter the number of trials to run: 100000\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of getting snake eyes is: 2.77%\n",
    "\n",
    "Goodbye!\n",
    "```\n",
