    "## Instructions\n",
    "Write a function called `roll_die` that takes no arguments, but returns one value. This functions job is to simulate rolling a die with 6-total sides.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Write the **function definition header**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def roll_die():\n",
    "  #write the function body code (the code that does the work), here\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2) The **function body** code should generate a random integer between 1 and n.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example code below generates a random integer in python between 1 and 5 and stores it in a variable called  `result`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import random\n",
    "result = random.randint(1,5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3) After the work is done, this function should **return** the randomly generated integer value.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Write a **main() function** and call your `roll_die()` function from there. Catch the result in some variable.\n",
    "5) Output the results from main().\n",
