    "A **list** is an *ordered*, *mutable*, collection of *elements*. We use **lists** to store *multiple* values in a *single* variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "![image of a python List with labels](../../../images/lists.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Terminology\n",
    "* Each item of a list is called an **element**\n",
    "* The position of an element inside a list is called its **index**. In Python, the very first element is at index **0**\n",
    "* The total number of elements inside a list is called its **size** (or **length**)\n",
    "* A collection like a List is considered **mutable** if the values stored in it can be updated and changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Do We Use Them?\n",
    "* Store Multiple Values: Use a *single* **list** instead of creating *multiple* variables\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ordered Collection: The order of elements in the **list** is preserved\n",
    "* Mutability: **Lists** can be modified; elements can be added, removed, or changed\n",
    "* Versatile: Lists can hold elements of *different* data types\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples of Collections as Lists\n",

    "**a. Suppose you need to go grocery shopping.**\n",

    "shopping list = Bread, milk, eggs, chips\n",
    "* The elements are bread, milk, eggs, and chips\n",
    "* Bread is at index 0, milk is at index 1, eggs is at index 2, and chips is at index 3\n",
    "* The size of this list is 4\n",
    "\n",
    "**b. Suppose you need to store information about a car.** \n",
    "\n",
    "car information = Toyota, Camry, 2017, 1.6L, 38.6\n",
    "\n",
    "* The elements are Toyota, Camry, 2017, 1.6L, and 38.6 \n",
    "* Toyota is at index 0, Camry is at index 1, 2017 is at index 2, 1.6L is at index 3, and 38.6 is at index 4\n",
    "* The size of this list is 5\n",
    "\n",
    "**c. Suppose you need to store the scores of a class.**\n",
    "test scores = 90, 85, 82\n",
    "\n",
    "* The elements are 90, 85, and 82\n",
    "* 90 us at index, 0, 85 is at index 1, and 82 is at index 2\n",
    "* The size of this list is 3\n",
