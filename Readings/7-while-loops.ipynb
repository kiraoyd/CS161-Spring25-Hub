    "\n",
    "One of the great powers of computing, is the speed at which computers can perform tasks. The Aurora super compuer for example, can perform **1,000,000,000,000,000,000** floating point mathematical operations **per second**. Computers are hugely productive calculation machines!\n",
    "\n",
    "But imagine having to write 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 individual lines of code to perform 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 mathematical operations.  Sounds terrible right? Downright impossible maybe. If anything, a terribly ineffient way to try to take advantage of a computers speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, computer programming languages have a construct built into them to account for this: **Loops**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Loops** allow us to instruct the computer to perform operations repeatedly, using only a handful of lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "----------\n",
    "In Python, a `while` loop is used to execute a specific block of code, for as long as some specified condition is `True`. It's a useful tool for minimizing rewriting code that needs to be repeated.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Syntax\n",
    "Setting up a `while` loop looks awfully similar to setting up a conditional if-statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "A while` loop` begins with the keyword `while`. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is followed by some **condition** that can evaluate to either `True` or `False`. \n",
    "\n",
    "After which is the colon symbol `:` , followed by all lines of code that should be repeated in the even that condition is True. \n",
    "\n",
    "Just like the if-statement, a `while` loop requires all the code inside it to be **indented** underneath the loop conditional statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Iterating a loop\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a loop is set up, the computer reads this code in a particular way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example demonstrates printing \"Hello\" multiple times. \n",
    "```python\n",
    "count = 0 # counting variable\n",
    "\n",
    "while count < 5:\n",
    "    print(\"Hello\")\n",
