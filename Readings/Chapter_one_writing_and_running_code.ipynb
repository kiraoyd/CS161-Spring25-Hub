    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "A **computer** is fundamentally a programmable device capable of performing computations based on a set of instructions, or a *program*. This device processes dataâ€”ranging from numbers and text to images and complex informationâ€”according to these instructions. Computers excel at storing, retrieving, and manipulating data, executing complex operations with remarkable speed and accuracy. Modern computers manifest in diverse forms, including personal computers, laptops, servers, and specialized devices, playing pivotal roles across science, engineering, business, and entertainment.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Computer Illustration](../images/modern_computer.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the essence of a computer extends beyond electronics. Historically, the term \"computer\" referred to individuals, often women, who performed complex calculations. The \"Harvard Computers,\" for instance, were employed to conduct astronomical computations. Thus, \"computer\" was once a professional title.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Historical Computer](../images/computer.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "While contemporary computers are electronic, the concept is broader. Computers can be constructed using light, DNA, or even mechanical systems like TinkerToys. At their core, all computers manipulate data according to a set of instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Theoretical Underpinning: Turing's Machine\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The theoretical foundation of modern computing traces back to 1936, predating the advent of electronic computers. Alan Turing, a visionary mathematician, sought to address a fundamental question: \"What are the limits of mathematics? What can be computed, and what truths are beyond computation?\" Turing conceived a theoretical device, the *Turing Machine*, which provided a definitive answer: any problem that can be mathematically computed can be programmed on a Turing Machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alan Turing](../images/turing.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Equivalence of Computational Power\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Although modern computers differ in architecture from Turing's machine, they are mathematically equivalent. This equivalence implies that any computable problem can be programmed on any modern computer. From the microcontrollers in microwaves to high-performance supercomputers, all computers share the same fundamental computational abilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Turing Machine Simulation](../images/turing_machine.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "This principle has profound implications. It means any program can, in theory, run on any computer, albeit with varying degrees of implementation complexity. However, it also underscores that not all problems are computationally solvable. Turing's work demonstrated the existence of problems that are fundamentally beyond the reach of any computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Turing's machine operated on the principle of manipulating symbols on a tape, devoid of inherent knowledge of numbers. Similarly, electronic computers operate on patterns of electrical voltages (e.g., binary representations). While we interact with computers at a higher level, utilizing pre-programmed mathematical operations and functionalities, the underlying mechanism remains symbol manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, despite the apparent sophistication of modern computing, all computers, regardless of their size or complexity, possess equivalent computational power, constrained by the fundamental limits established by Turing's theoretical framework. **All computers are exactly the same in terms of what they can do.**\n"

They are used by computer programmers to edit source code, and can be easier to use than other text editors for new programmers. They can have compilers so programmers don't have to open other programs to compile the source code. They also often have syntax highlighting. ... It also may have predictive coding that can finish lines with syntax such as brackets or semicolons and can suggest variables to be used. It also may have debuggers that can step through lines, take breaks and inspect variables. <br> <br> <b>Source: Simple Wikipedia </b></blockquote></details>\n"
