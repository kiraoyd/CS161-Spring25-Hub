    "\n",
    "When moving forward to a new index in a string, or a List, we might want to **wrap around** or loop back to the front of the data structure.\n",

    "print(data[new_index]) #error!!!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Anytime we want to shift an index value by adding some integer to it, we can mod the resulting new index value by the size of the String or List to guarantee that we stay in bounds:\n",
