    "## Functions: the tools of code abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Most modern programming languages empower you, the programmer, to define and write your own functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are called **user-defined functions**, and are fundamental to good code abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "User-defined functions allow us to encapsulate specific tasks into reusable blocks of code. We get to make our own custom tools to be used as many times as we want inside out programs!\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions as a concept aren't actually new, you've been using them all along:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `print()`\n",
    "- `input()`\n",
    "- `float()`\n",
    "- `int()`\n",
    "\n",
    "These tools are all made up of code written by someone, that was rigorously tested, verified, and then uploaded to the massive Python standard library of functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use them, you don't need to know what the code driving them is, you just need to know what each function does:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `print()` - displays what you give it\n",
    "- `input()`- pauses the program and waits for input\n",
    "- `float()`- converts the value you give it to a floating point data type\n",
    "- `int()`- converts the value you give it to an integer data type\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using** a function, is called **calling** a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"Hello World\") #calling print()\n",
    "\n",
    "age = input(\"Enter your age: \") #calling input()\n",
    "\n",
    "age_number = int(age) #calling int()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Writing our own functions\n",
    "As it turns out, we can also write and **define** our own functions. We can create our own custom tools called **user-defined functions** that we can call and use within out programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can write a **user-defined function** to carry out any task in your program. Each user-defined function you write should have one, specific job.\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating a user-defined function, we need to consider these things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) What work does the function do (what is its job)?\n",
    "2) What information, if any, does the function need to do its job?\n",
    "3) What information, if any, does the function send back once its job is done?\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the `float()`function:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Its **job** is to convert a value you give it, into a floating point data type\n",
    "2) It needs to be **passed** some value to be able to run this conversion.\n",
    "3) When it's done converting, it should send back, or **return**, the new converted value (otherwise what was the point of doing its work at all?)\n",

    "## Defining A Function\n",
    "----------\n",
    "Functions must first be **defined** before they can be used. Function definitions are composed of two parts, the header and the body.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Function Header\n",
    "\n",
    "The **function header** contains the `def` keyword which signals the definition of a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The header also contains the **name of the function**. Function names follow the same rules as variable names; letters, numbers, and underscores, and should start with a verb. This will help make your program read like a story. Function names cannot start with a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parentheses** are required right after the function name. (in the later section about parameters, we will talk about what we can include inside these parenthesis).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the header ends with a colon `:` symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Function Header Image](../images/function-header.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Function Body\n",
    "The **function body** is the list of actions the function performs. All of the code for the function body must be indented (four spaces is the Python standard) from the function header. The function ends when the code is no longer indented.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Function Body Image](../images/function-body.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Function Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "After the function is defined, you can execute it by **calling** the function.\n",
