## Directory Guide:



### **Class-Notes** 
Notebooks containing notes and code written live in class.

### **Extra-Practice-Problems** 
Extra practice problems for, you guessed it, more practice coding! These are **not graded**. Each of these problems comes with a Notebook and a solution .py code file.
> The **Notebook** contains instructions, helpful information, and a Code Cell to start writing and running code.
>
>
>The **.py Solution Code File** has solution code written into it. The solution code is hidden farther down the file. Scroll down to line 50 to view it. This .py file can be run from the Terminal Window.

### **Graded-Practice-Problems** 
Required and graded Practice Problems. Each of these problems comes with a Notebook and a .py code file. 
> The **Notebook** contains instructions, helpful information, and a Code Cell to start writing and running code.
>
>
>The **.py Code File** is where the finished solution code needs to be written into or copied over from the Notebook Code Cell. The .py file is then downloaded from the workspace, and uploaded to the associated Canvas assignment for submission.

### **Images** 
Ignore this Directory. It contains images used in the instructions/readings.

### **Readings** 
Contains the interactive textbook readings for the course. Each reading is presented as a Notebook containing content as well as runable Code Cells to write and run the accompanying activities in.

## All content in this Workspace will be updated regularly.
